## 1. Reason for the base image choice in the Dockerfile 

The image used is node:16.18.1-alpine. The node version is scaled down in size compared to the original node version. Addition of Alpine scaled it down even more and at the same time achieving efficiency, compatibility and reduced vulnerabilities. 

## 2. Dockerfile structure breakdown

    FROM - Defines the image we will use as the basis for our container.

    WORKDIR - Command that sets the working directory for the application

    COPY package.json* ./- A wildcard is used to ensure both package.json AND package-lock.json are copied to the working directory                  

    RUN - Command to install all the required, debug, and execute commands in the container. 

    COPY . . - Command ensures all the files in the current directory are copied to the app directory

    EXPOSE - Tells Docker which ports the container should listen on during runtime.

    CMD - #pecifies the command that should be executed when the docker container starts.

## 3. Volume creation in docker-compose.yml
Due to the persistence of data to be added in the website as its functionality, a volume is created to cater for data storage. It is created using the command:

    docker volume create mongodb

## 4. Network creation in docker-compose.yml
A bridge network is created to facilitate communication ease in the app's container. This was done through the command: 

    docker network create mongo_net

## 5. Github commits 
Outlined below are the commits that outline how i was able to dockerize the application and what facilitated efficient running. It's order is from the newest to the oldest. I got this breakdown via the command :

## Challenges faced ( Working on it)
The frontend (Client) install in the Dockerfile isn't working. It keeps giving an error :

     npm ERR! errno FETCH_ERROR
    npm ERR! invalid json response body at https://registry.npmjs.org/babel-loader reason: Invalid response body while trying to fetch https://registry.npmjs.org/babel-loader: Socket timeout 

I have been trying to solve it for days because the install leads to the abortion of the entire process hence no  custom frontend image created. I have changed the version installed a couple of times, i have no issues with my network but it keeps on failing. I am still working on the issue.

## 6. Google K8s Project Deployment expound 
 ## Use of StatefulSets

 This project has StatefulSets implemented in it. A StatefulSet represents a set of pods unique, persistent and with a stable pod name tied to the mongo database that help in maintaining the state of the database by creating replicas that aid in its state maintenance in
 case one fails.

  ## Pods exposure to the internet traffic
To expose the created pods to the internet, i have implemented services tied to the affected pods that will help
