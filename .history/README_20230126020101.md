## Google K8s Project Deployment expound 
 ## Use of StatefulSets

 This project has StatefulSets implemented in it. A StatefulSet represents a set of pods unique, persistent and with a stable pod name tied to the mongo database that help in maintaining the state of the database to prevent loss of data.

  ## Pods exposure to the internet traffic
To expose the created pods to the internet, i have implemented services tied to the affected pods that will facilitate its  internet access. The services used is node-service using load-balancer for the frontend and backend together with mongo service for the database
 
 ## Use of persistent storage 

 A PersistentVolume (PV) is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned using Storage Classes. Tied to the database are .yaml files that facilitate for its implementation . This also is done through facilitating for persistence volume claim which is a request for storage by a user, that sets aside the resources requested t.

# Requirements
Make sure that you have the following installed:
- [node](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-18-04) 
- npm 
- [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/) and start the mongodb service with `sudo service mongod start`

## Navigate to the Client Folder 
 `cd client`

## Run the folllowing command to install the dependencies 
 `npm install`

## Run the folllowing to start the app
 `npm start`

## Open a new terminal and run the same commands in the backend folder
 `cd ../backend`

 `npm install`

 `npm start`

 ### Go ahead and add a product (note that the price field only takes a numeric input)

## DOCKER GUIDELINES 
## Create the docker network :
    docker network create mongo_net

## Create the docker volume :
    docker volume create mongodb

## Navigate to the root of the project's directory:
    cd yolo-soipan

 ## Run docker-compose.yml file
    docker-compose up

 ## Open the app's frontend which is the project's client folder at localhost:3000

 ## Upon the use of custom docker images, your docker-compose.yml file should resemble this format : 


     backend:
        image: namayiana/yolo-backend:v1.0.0
        build: 
            context: backend
            dockerfile: ./Dockerfile
        ports:
            - "3000:3000"
        depends_on:
            - mongo
        environment:
            - DB_HOST=mongo
            - DB_USER=admin
            - DB_PASSWORD=password
        volumes:
            - mongodb:/data/db
        networks:
            - mongo_net
    

    frontend:
        image: namayiana/yolo-frontend:v1.0.0
        build: 
            context: client
            dockerfile: Dockerfile
        ports:
            - "3000:3000"
        depends_on:
            - mongo
        environment:
            - DB_HOST=mongo
            - DB_USER=admin
            - DB_PASSWORD=password
        volumes:
            - mongodb:/data/db
        networks:
            - mongo_net
